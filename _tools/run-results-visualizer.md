This interactive tool helps analyze the execution timeline of your dbt models. Locate your `run_results.json` file (typically in the `target/` directory) to see a detailed Gantt chart of your execution times.

This visualization is entirely client-side, so it should be fast, and does not share any data to me whatsoever.
