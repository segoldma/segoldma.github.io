I registered the seth.cool domain in 2016 with no project in mind – only the misguided assumptions that someone else would buy it, and that I’m cool. A couple years later, I decided to use my first-mover’s advantage to share data-related projects as I worked on them.

This was partially motivated by an attempt to transition my career from customer support / customer success to data analysis -- a casual portfolio to "prove" my ability to analyze, visualize, and write about data, as my résumé and academic background did not inherently suggest experience in any of these areas. 

I wrote an extended retrospective of my path into data [here](../2022/01/04/weird-path-into-data.html).

In recent years, the blog has gone mostly dormant as I've stopped sharing analyses. This is largely because I've been lucky to become a *real* professional data practitioner, and no longer feel as much pressure to maintain a public portfolio. 

As of early 2024, I'm migrating this blog from the `blogdown` R package, to Jekyll + GitHub Pages. I'm hopeful to start publishing again, but will likely focus more on topics of analytics engineering and SQL various SQL craft.
